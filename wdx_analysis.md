# Women’s Education effects on Health, and the Economy 

Girl’s education affects many aspects of a nation as a whole. An increase in girl’s education can affect the nation’s economy as a whole and benefit women’s health and the health of their families. In this blog we will explore metrics used to measure the state of girl’s education across the world and specific cases in Mali and Chile. We will also draw comparisons with the state of girl’s education as related to other nation indicators; and determine factors that affect the ability of girls to receive education. 

To answer these questions, we will use data provided by The World Bank and charts published on the World Development Explorer website, which utilized The World Bank’s data. The World Bank consists of five institutions from both the public and private sector: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), The International Development Association (IDA), The International Finance Corporation (IFC), The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Together their mission is to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. The World Bank produces World Development Indicators (WDI), a cross-country comparable data set on development (reference). WDI’s range from indicators on people, the environment and the economy, there are more than 1400 socioeconomic indicators of 200 plus countries over 50 plus year (WDE).

First, looking at school enrollment (% female, net) vs. literacy rate (% female age 15-24) we can determine where countries are in terms in girl’s education. From the following graph, one can determine how countries performed in terms of girls education in 2010.

Grouping all the countries by income level can provide insight on how income could be related to women’s education. Note the three countries with the worst literacy rates among females age 15-25 are all low income. An explanation for the correlation could be that women in low income countries are required to work to support their family and therefore cannot attend school.

Specifically, we can see the correlations between income levels and literacy rates when directly comparing Mali and Chili. Mali is classified as a low income country and Chili is classified as a High Income country. As the Plot 2 indicates, Chilies literacy rates among women aged 15-25 is higher than Mali’s by roughly 65%.

In order to answer the question of whether girl’s education and literacy rates effect a nations economy, we can analyze the GDP Per Capita indicator. As shown in Plot 3 from a variety of countries grouped by income level, all countries on the plot with a high GDP have close to 100% literacy rate. We can also look at Mali’s GDP and women’s literacy data over time and determine that as the countries literacy rate among 15-25 year old women increase, as does it’s GDP (Plots 5 & 6). Likely because there are more workers able to do jobs that require an education.

Not only does women’s literacy correlate with GDP, but it also affects women’s own life expectancy, and the health of their families. As the following plots show, Chile, a country with higher literacy rates as shown above, has a larger percentage of their female population over 80 years old, and has a smaller percentage of still birth per 1,000 births when compared to Mali in 2010.

In conclusion, from analyzing many indicators from the The World Bank’s dataset using the The World Development Explorer Tool, one can conclude from Mali’s and Chiles data that there is a correlation between women’s literacy, girl’s enrollment in primary education, income level of a country, GDP, women’s health and maternal health (specifically measured by life expectancy and still birth likelihood). Revealing all the benefits of women’s education and researching the aspects that contribute to low education and literacy levels through data can bring us closer towards The World Bank’s Mission of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity.
